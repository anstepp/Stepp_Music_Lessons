## Music theory crash course for singer-songwriters

I’m offering an introductory music theory course for singer-songwriters in ten, one-hour sessions. I’ve taught classes and lessons in theory for songwriters and musicians over the past 20 years, and want to help you advance your writing and listening skills.

### What we will do

- Musical form, helping diversify your songwriting and enhancing communication with backing musicians
  
- Nashville Numbers and reading lead sheets, so you can better communicate your ideas with other musicians and improve your study skills
  
- The language of music theory including relationships between scientific measurements (Hz, etc) and musical notation (A-flat, etc), giving you confidence to express your desires to recording engineers.
  
- How chord progressions and cadences work, so you can vary your musical ideas in your songs and create your unique voice
  
- Basic Music Technology concepts, demystifying recording technology and jargon so you can make sure you get the best available product from your recording and mastering engineers
  
- Practice techniques so you can continue developing your skills after the lessons 

Knowledge is power, and I can help you become a more confident artist, songwriter, and musician.

I look forward to hearing from you!
