## Music theory crash course for singer-songwriters

- Make your songs have more impact
- Spice up your chord progressions
- Develop more original melodies
- Improve your musicianship


My music theory "crash course" for singer-songwriters is a course of ten one-hour sessions. This course will help you improve your skills as a songwriter (or producer), and is designed to give you understanding of relevant music theory that will help you feel more confident in the practice room, studio, and while songwriting.

### What we will do

- Discuss how to talk about the form of a song to improve rehearsal and songwriting, using examples from popular music.

- Understand basic musical theory - how to determine key, basic chromaticism, and the musical alphabet (for instance - why is it A-flat major, but G-sharp minor?)

- Basic relationships between technical expressions (Hz, etc.) and musical expression (A-flat, etc.)

- Tonal vs. modal harmony, using examples from popular music

### What we won’t do

- Counterpoint (unless you want!)

- Roman numeral analysis of Bach chorales (unless you want!)

- Learning about 16th-Century Church music (again, unless you want!)


Knowledge is power, and I’ve got a 20-year track record of helping musicians across genres and of all ages develop confidence, knowledge, and skills to help them grow in their musical journey. I’d love to help you improve your skills and confidence in creating individual expressions through songs and music.
